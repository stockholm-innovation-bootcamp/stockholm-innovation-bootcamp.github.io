Official repo for the website of Stockholm Startup Bootcamp 

Welcome to the Stockholm Startup Bootcamp Github page!

Here we publish resources, tools, and code from the bootcamp. 

The first bootcamp will be held in January 2020 and is open to law and business school students as well as computer sciense and software engineer students in and around Stockholm. 

We are currently looking for partnerships for the bootcamp. Interested parties are welcomed to reach out to us to hear more about how to get involved.
