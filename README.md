Official repo for the website of Stockholm Innovation Bootcamp 

Welcome to the Stockholm Innovation Bootcamp Github page!

Here we publish resources, tools, and code from the bootcamp. 

The second bootcamp will be held in October 2021 and is open to law, design and business school students as well as computer sciense and software engineer students in and around Stockholm. All educationlevels are welcomed!

We are currently looking for partnerships for the bootcamp. Interested parties are welcomed to reach out to us to hear more about how to get involved.
