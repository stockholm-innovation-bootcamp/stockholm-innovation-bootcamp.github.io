            <h3> Welcome to Stockholm Startup Bootcamp</h3>

            <p>
                <p>Would you like to experience problem solving in action?
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    <ul style="list-style-type: square type circle;">
                        <li>Hands-on experience in interdisciplinary teams</li>
                        <li>The legal, business and tech field joining forces </li>
                        <li>Real challenges, real solutions</li>
                    </ul>
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>Stockholm Startup Bootcamp is an interdisciplinary hands-on workshop on entrepreneurship, design thinking and innovation.

                </p>
                <br>
                <p>During the intense 3-day bootcamp, students will get to experience what design thinking and innovation can be in practise and learn from industry veterans by being faced with real challenges from industry entities and government branches.
                    At the end of the camp, the solutions are pitched to stakeholders whom will offer feedback on the work.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>The Bootcamp offers a great opportunity for any student to expand networks and put own field knowledge into practise, whilst being introduced to the world of startups.
                </p>
            </p>

            <h4>For whom?</h4>

            <p>
                <p>Students with focus on law, technology, software engineering or business at any University!
                </p>
                <p>Exchange/International student? You are also welcomed to apply like your swedish fellows! </p>
                <br>
                <p>No prior knowledge is required, only a curiosity about tech and innovation. The Bootcamp is held in English, so a good understanding of, and vocabulary in, English is beneficial. Don't worry; "badenglish" works too!</p>
                </p>
    <h4>Costs?</h4>
    
    <p> We want as many students as possible to feel comfortable attending, and therefore we do not at this moment charge a fee for attending. </p>
    
    <p> We do enforce a penalty fee for "noshows", i.e. the students who are accepted but do not show up at the event onsite. The penalty fee goes towards the next Bootcamp or is donated to a charitable cause.</p>
    

            <h4>Agenda - 24th-26th of January 2020</h4>
            <p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Day 1 - Kick-off dinner! Meet your interdisciplinary team and get introduced to the challenge.</li>
