            <h3> Welcome to Stockholm Startup Bootcamp</h3>

            <p>
                <p>Would you like to experience problem solving in action?
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    <ul style="list-style-type: square type circle;">
                        <li>Hands-on experience in interdisciplinary teams</li>
                        <li>The legal, business and tech field joining forces </li>
                        <li>Real challenges, real solutions</li>
                    </ul>
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>Stockholm Startup Bootcamp is an interdisciplinary hands-on workshop on entrepreneurship, design thinking and innovation.

                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    The Bootcamp offers a great opportunity to work together with students from all kinds of disciplines while solving real challenges and getting hands-on experience in design thinking and lean startup methods.

                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    Each participant is given an interdisciplinary team, and each team gets introduced to a challenge. The challenge itself is not revealed until the kick-off night of the Bootcamp, but it is related to a digitalised society and presented to you by industry
                    entities and government branches.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The team then has the chance to brainstorm around the challenge, pick it to pieces, question and criticise and put each participants field knowledge into real action. Maybe you figure out how to disrupt an industry, or how to tackle environmental issues?
                    The objective is just to run with it, to use an insane amount of post-it notes and to have fun!

                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    The solutions will look very differently from team to team, and from challenge to challenge. Lastly, prototypes, pitch-decks or movies presenting your solution will be put in the spotlight for our judges to review and present their feedback on.

                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    You don’t have to have any prerequisites to participate. Curiosity goes a long way.

                </p>
                <br>
                <p>The Bootcamp offers a great opportunity for any student to expand their network and put their own field knowledge into practise, whilst being introduced to the world of startups.
                </p>

            </p>

            <h4>For whom?</h4>

            <p>

                <p>Students with focus on law, technology, software engineering or business at any university!
                </p>

                <br>
                <p>Exchange/International student? You are also welcomed to apply like your Swedish fellows! </p>

                <br>
                <p>No prior knowledge is required, only a curiosity about tech and innovation. The Bootcamp is held in English, so a good understanding of, and vocabulary in, English is beneficial. Don't worry; "badenglish" works too!</p>
            </p>
            <h4>Costs?</h4>

            <p> We want as many students as possible to feel comfortable attending, and therefore we do not charge a fee for attending. </p>

            <p> We do enforce a penalty fee for "noshows", i.e. the students who are accepted but do not show up at the event onsite. The penalty fee goes towards the next Bootcamp or is donated to a charitable cause.</p>
