                    <li>Marketing permissions and prohibitions: We take photographs and record video at all of our events. If we photograph you in particular and not the whole audience or ambience, we will ask for your consent to publish the image. Your picture
                        may also be recorded by our live streaming cameras.
                    </li>

                </ul>
            </p>
            <p>You can influence the type of data we collect. However, participation in our events requires that you submit your personal data. If you decide not to submit your personal data to us, we may be unable to provide all the possibilities of our
                events to you.
            </p>

            <h4>3. What is the data used for?</h4>
            <p>
                We process your data in order to organize our events. We also process your data if it is necessary for the realization our legitimate interest.

            </p>
            <p>
                “Legitimate interest” refers to our actions that are allowed by law and which are in direct relation to our operations. We may act on the grounds of legitimate interest where a significant and pertinent relationship exists between the participant and
                us. This means that the relationship has been formed for the purpose of participating in our events itself or in the organization of the event in the role of e.g. audience, a member of organizers or a member of partnering organizations.
            </p>
            <p>
                In assessing legitimate interest, both the interests of the participant and ours are evaluated, taking in to account the realization of fundamental rights, the nature and purpose of use of the data collected, and data security. This process has been explained
                e.g. by the European Data Authorities and we follow these established guidelines.

            </p>
            <p>
                The participant has the right to object to processing that occurs on the basis of a legitimate interest. We explain this further in section 8. In some cases, we may ask your consent for processing your data for example by using opt-in checkboxes in registration
                or other forms.
            </p>
            <p>
                We also process your data to better be able to market our event. We may also process your data when conducting marketing surveys and opinion polls to gain a better understanding of our participants and thereby make the event better. We target our content
                to provide you with information about our event that is as relevant as possible. The targeting of our content is based on interests and information we have collected. For example, we might send different information to investors than startup
                entrepreneurs.
            </p>

            <p>
                We process the data for analysis, for compiling statistics and reporting, again, mainly to develop our event and to improve the participant experience.

            </p>
            <h4>4. How long do we store your data?</h4>

            <p>
                We do not store your data any longer than necessary for the purposes described in this Privacy Policy and to comply with any mandatory legislation. We delete your data 30 days after the ending of each Bootcamp. We may store the data longer if you give
                us your consent to do so.

            </p>
            <p>
                Please note that regardless of what has been said above, we may make an exception in retention period when a legal claim is made against us or when the handling of matters related to such a claim is incomplete or when the law requires us to do so.

            </p>
            <h4>
                5. Who can process your data and do we disclose it to third parties?
            </h4>

            <p>
                Your data is processed within the Stockholm Startup Bootcamp team. We may disclose your data to the authorities, for example, if the law requires us to do so. To fulfil our contractual obligations, we may disclose personal data to third parties. Such
                third parties include for example our partner offering to host the Bootcamp e.g. namelists at the door. These parties may also act as the controller in terms of personal data needed for the registration. We advise you to read the data
                protection policies of these parties.

            </p>
            <p>
                However, we do not, as a rule, disclose your data to third parties in such a manner that they would be able to use it for other purposes than those defined by us. When using subcontractors or service providers we obligate them with appropriate contractual

            <p>

            </p>

            <p>
